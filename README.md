# Finding server IP address
New since 1.1:
1. The server IP address will be put in the box next to the start/stop buttons on the server instance.
OBSOLETE:
1. Open a command prompt (Win + R and type 'cmd') on the server.
2. Type 'ipconfig' and press enter.
3. Look for the adapter that connects you to your home network (the same the client is on).
4. The IPv4 address will be the address you are looking for.
